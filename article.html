<p>Growing Neural Cellular Automata </p>

<p>Computational models are essential tools for understanding and predicting the behaviour of physical systems in many domains of science. However they generally require significant research and engineering to create, and thus can be a limiting factor when studying these systems (possible to cite something here?). But what if it is possible to learn them automatically from data? Recently significant progress has been made in this area (cite fluid sim research, cosmology, hamiltonian nn, symbolic sim, gamegan, ect. Any survey papers?), and it appears to be a promising direction of research. There is a general class of models which are often used across domains of science ranging from particle physics, chemistry, fluid dynamics, biology, meteorology, and cosmology. This model goes by different names... Cellular models are particularly interesting because they possess a minimal set of inductive biases that match physical systems. A common goal for theoretical models is to be invariant in space and time. </p>

<p>Useful properties of physical models: invariant in space and time. Locality.</p>
<p>Graphs with uniform structure satisfy all of these properties. They go by many different names such as cellular, grid, or lattice methods are already widely used in science (research some good citation(s) for this). </p>

<p>The way we interact with computational models varies greatly. Some models are run on large clusters or supercomputers for weeks and their results may be analyzed for months or years. Some run in real-time on consumer devices and provide an instantaneous feedback loop. </p>

<p><u>Introduction, background</u></p>
<p>Creating computational models of complex dynamical systems is a recurring challenge across nearly all domains of science, and generally requires significant research and engineering. What if it were possible to learn models directly from data that are efficient enough for interactive applications?</p>

<p>It turns out that a surprising number of these systems can be well described by rules of local interactions. Physical systems ranging from chemical compounds to global climate, and biological systems ranging from individual cells to social systems all exhibit high-level behaviours which are the product of interactions between many tiny components. This favoritism of local interactions is actually very natural. In physics, the “principle of locality”, loosely says that all interactions between objects are fundamentally local, and that distant interactions must be mediated by local interactions. Even phenomena which appear to evolve instantaneously such as light and gravity are most accurately modeled as propagating waves. It follows that models which capture dynamics more locally are more accurate and efficiently represented.</p>

<p>Interest because of computational scalability. </p>

<p>The neural CA framework is a useful system for automatically modeling these systems. </p>

<p>Cellular automata are effective models of physical systems, even those composed of discrete particles.</p>

<p>(Overview of learning the dynamics of physical systems). These model architectures are specialized...</p>
<p>Previous work demonstrates learning the dynamics of a system end-to-end from video [6-7].</p>

<p><u>Model</u></p>
<p>Mostly the same as the original model in [1]. No alive/alpha masking, and initial states are random in each batch.</p>

<p>Experiments</p>

<p>I</p>
<p>Modeling discrete particles with local interactions</p>


<p><u>Chosen Physical System</u></p>
<p>The modeled system chosen for this experiment is a frictionless billiards-like particle system. This has a few desirable properties: local interactions between particles, subtle collision dynamics, and easy assessment of accuracy when visualized. </p>
<p>Concretely, the motion of one particle due to another is specified by the differential equation:</p>

<p><u>latex</u></p>

<p>Where <strong>r</strong> is the difference vector between the two, k is a force scaling constant, and p_s is the diameter of the billiard particles.</p>
<p>This system can be integrated with satisfactory accuracy using simple forward Euler integration as shown in the pseudo-python below:</p>
<p></p>
<p>The last step is to render the particle system so that we can optimize the CA model using pixel MSE loss. Expressing the velocity of each particle in polar coordinates, and mapping this into HSV color space using hue=theta, saturation=r, and value=constant, velocities can be cleanly encoded in the RGB channels of the model’s state. This mapping from R^2 -> rgb is intuitively visualized as a color wheel:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Note that this conversion limits the maximum velocity which can be encoded, but this is okay because any CA system naturally already has a maximum speed (one cell per step) which information can propagate.</p>
<p>Putting this together, our reference particle system looks like this:</p>
<p>(remove interpolation, compression :p)</p>


<p><u>Training Setup, Results</u></p>
<p>Todo</p>
<p>(include videos of system evolution at intermediate training steps)</p>
<p>(Include model falling back to probability distributions when optimized over too many time steps)</p>

<h1>A Minimalist Google Docs Workflow for Distill.pub</h1>

<p>The typical process of a <a href='https://distill.pub/'>Distill.pub</a> article creation requires all contributors and editors to be familiar with version control (specifically Git) and web development, which sets an unnecessarily high barrier for entry to accept edits and suggestions from reviewers. This repository contains an article template and instructions for setting up a workflow based on Google Docs which exports the article HTML to GitHub. </p>

<p>The workflow also uses a minimalistic Python web-server that automatically fetches new changes from GitHub and recompiles the article to serve the draft locally. We also provide a minimal Jekyll configuration that allows you to see changes live on GitHub Pages. </p>

<p>This workflow was organically developed while writing our first Distill article <d-cite key="mordvintsev2020growing"></d-cite> and noticing that we really needed the collaborative functionality of Google Docs, but wanted a live preview of our article while working.</p>
<h2 id='getting-started'>Getting Started</h2>

<ul><li>Fork and rename the <a href='https://github.com/znah/gdocs_distill_template'>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;znah&#x2F;gdocs_distill_template</a> repository. Convention is to name it &quot;post--<i>canonicalized-article-name</i>&quot;. </li>
<li>Duplicate this Google Document for your article.<i> </i>This also duplicates the attached Google Script allowing export to GitHub.</li>
<li>Update <i>github_repo</i> variable in above table to point to your GitHub repository.</li>
<li>Click &quot;HTML Export&quot; -&gt; &quot;Run Export&quot;. You will be prompted for a GitHub API token the first time you run this. This is privately stored for your Google account and not accessible by anyone else opening the Google Doc. Give the token "repo" permissions. Get the token <a href='https://github.com/settings/tokens'>here</a>.</li></ul>

</figure>
<ul><li>Enable GitHub pages for the repository under <i>Settings</i>, if not already enabled. </li>
<li>Update the <i>password</i><i><strong> </i></strong>parameter in main.html to a password of your choosing. The default password is <strong>selforgtheworld</strong>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <i>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;username.github.com&#x2F;post--canonicalized-article-name&#x2F;public</i> to see a live draft of the page. This draft typically updates within 30-40 seconds after running an export. The link to the rendered version of this tutorial is <a href='https://eyvind.me/gdocs_distill_template/public/'>here</a><strong>.</strong></li></ul>

<h2 id='optional-adding'>(Optional) Adding to Existing Google Doc</h2>
<p>Alternatively you can install the script manually on an existing Google Doc.</p>

<ul><li>Press Tools-&gt;Script Editor. The new "Apps Script" tab will open.</li>
<li>In the Script Editor tab replace the content of the "Code.gs" script with the code from "bin&#x2F;gdoc2html.gs". You can also rename "Untitled project" into something meaningful.</li>
<li>Go back to the document tab and reload it. The new "HTML Export" menu will appear.</li></ul>
<h2 id='features'>Features</h2>
<h3>Citations</h3>
<p>To insert citations, edit the file &quot;<i>public&#x2F;bibliography.bib</i>&quot; and add citations in the BibTex format.  Then, in the text, simply insert a citation as can be seen in the Google Doc <d-cite key="mordvintsev_niklasson"></d-cite>. This will show up as a footnote with a bibliography at the end, placed using the &lt;d-citation-list&gt; section.</p>
<h3>Colab Button</h3>
<p>There is built in support for a &quot;Try in Colab&quot; button. To insert this, make sure you have the <i><strong>colab</i></strong> constant defined in the constants table in the doc. Simple write </p>
<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-research/self-organising-systems/blob/master/notebooks/growing_ca.ipynb#scrollTo=lyxeGm6dJX8D" class="colab-root">Reproduce in a <span class="colab-span">Notebook</span></a> </p>
<p>to insert a colab link. This will be rendered as a link with a <i>scrollTo </i>the specified section of the colab.</p>
<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
<p>The export script respects hyperlinks and hyperlinked text in Google Docs, and faithfully reproduces it in the rendered HTML.</p>
<h3>Smart Quotes</h3>
<p>By default Google Docs uses &quot;smart quotes&quot; (UTF-8 quotes which differ based on whether they are at the beginning or end of a phrase). This does not play well with HTML. The export script replaces these quotes with the standard ASCII double and single quotes.</p>

<h3>Lists and sublists</h3>
<ul><li>The script faithfully reproduces lists as HTML lists. </li><ul>
<li>It respects nesting.</li><ul><ul><ul>
<li>Even discontinuous nesting</li></ul></ul></ul></ul>
<li>To change the appearance of the HTML lists, please edit the stylesheet.</li></ul>
<h3>Latex</h3>
<p>The underlying Distill template has Latex compilation enabled. To insert equations, simply wrap them as follows: $(\vec{x} &gt; \vec{y}) \, \forall \, \vec{y}$.</p>
<h3>Custom HTML</h3>
<p>Most special characters (for HTML) in the Google Doc are escaped (&lt;, &gt;, &#x2F;, …). However, you can add HTML to have it be exported as-is to the generated HTML in GitHub. To do so, simply mark it as having the <i>Subtitle</i> paragraph style in Google Docs. If you duplicated this template, we have adjusted the <i>Subtitle</i> paragraph style to be visually unobtrusive. If you are using your own document from scratch, the functionality will still work and you can alter the <i>Subtitle</i> paragraph style to look how you want. For an example of inline HTML in the Google Doc, see the below footer code (in the rendered page, you will see the bibliography).</p>

<p><u>Discussion</u></p>
